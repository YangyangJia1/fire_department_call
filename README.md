## Introduction

This paper analysis the fire department call log in San Francisco from 2000 to 2004. We use Hadoop cluster and Hive QL to analyze the data set. It is categorized by the Call Number, Incident Number, Call Type, Call Date, Day, Month, Year, Address, Zip code, Box, Priority, ALS Unit, Number of Alarms, Unit Type, Neighborhood, Locations. By going through all the analyzation process, we are able to find out received the most number of calls, most incident prone area, leading incident that happened over the four years, the incident that required least dispatch unit etc.
